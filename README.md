We present VIVID3D, an innovative method for research using 3D technology.

# Overview
VIVID3D is an all new python package for simple scientific visualization and creation of 3D models. 
Visualize particle simulations like never before, with Voronoi Tesselation for realistic volume representation in 3D

VIVID3D was tested in our cosmology research group by producing models from simulations for researchers, supporting new scientific insights about the evolution of galaxies and structures of the Universe.

## Features
- **Fast execution** - C++ wrapped with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
- **Smart Isosurfaces** - Using a [3D Voronoi Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1088/0067-0049/216/2/35) implementation by Dr. Elad Steinnberg
- **Support for industry standard file formats** - Using the [Open Asset Import Library](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- **Point Clouds**
- **Vector Fields**
- **Scientific Analysis of Meshes**
