User Guide
##########

When working with vivid3d there are two main work flowes:

1. The simple approach, make_model() is a one-line model function, easy to use but with less user control.
2. The advanced approach, the model is built step-by-step with more control at every stage.

All examples will showcase both ways.
The first one is recommended for beginners and once you get the gist,
the advanced approach can get much better results.
