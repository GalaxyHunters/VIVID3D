    We present VIVID, an innovative method for easy particle simulation data visualization.
    
    VIVID uses an implementation of the voronoi algorithm for a 3D space made by Dr. Elad Stiennberg. 
    It takes simulation data as an input and produces an interactive 3D mesh model. The intuitive code allows for:
    
    - Animated models through time
    - Labeled surfaces
    - Color and opacity control
    - Shape creation
    - And more.
